            <p>Determining the most efficient approach involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understanding the Problem:</strong> Clearly defining inputs, outputs, constraints, and edge cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyzing Requirements:</strong> Evaluating whether the solution needs to optimize for time, space, or both.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploring Algorithms:</strong> Comparing algorithmic approaches (e.g., divide and conquer, dynamic programming).</li>
                <li><strong>Testing and Benchmarking:</strong> Implementing prototypes and measuring their performance against defined metrics.</li>
                <li><strong>Trade-off Analysis:</strong> Balancing between simplicity and efficiency based on requirements.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
            <p>Optimization is prioritized when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance is Critical:</strong> The solution must handle large-scale data or real-time requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost is a Concern:</strong> Efficient solutions reduce resource consumption.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. What trade-offs do you consider when solving problems?</h2>
            <p>Trade-offs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time vs. Space:</strong> Fast algorithms might use more memory (e.g., dynamic programming).</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity vs. Maintainability:</strong> Sophisticated algorithms can be harder to debug.</li>
                <li><strong>Short-Term vs. Long-Term Gains:</strong> Quick fixes may lead to technical debt.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy vs. Speed:</strong> Approximations may be sufficient in time-sensitive situations.</li>
