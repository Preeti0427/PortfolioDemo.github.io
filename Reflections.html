    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?</h2>
        <p>Problems in nature can often be modeled using the following computational approaches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Solving problems through repeated steps (e.g., calculating compound interest, searching through an array).</li>
            <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> Solving a problem by dividing it into smaller subproblems (e.g., Tower of Hanoi, Fibonacci sequence).</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Exploring all possible solutions and discarding invalid ones (e.g., N-Queens problem, maze-solving).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These approaches help solve real-world problems in physics, biology, and computer science.</p>

        <h2>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?</h2>
        <p>Space and time efficiency are critical measures of an algorithm's performance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Refers to the memory an algorithm uses during execution. Efficient space usage is important for handling large datasets on devices with limited memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Refers to the time an algorithm takes to complete. Faster algorithms are necessary for real-time applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Algorithm complexity is measured using Big-O notation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>O(1):</strong> Constant time (fastest).</li>
            <li><strong>O(log n):</strong> Logarithmic growth.</li>
            <li><strong>O(n):</strong> Linear growth.</li>
            <li><strong>O(n²):</strong> Quadratic growth (slower).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Takeaways from Design Principles (Chapter 2)</h2>
        <p>Key design principles include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Break problems into smaller, manageable subproblems (e.g., MergeSort, QuickSort).</li>
            <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Make the best local choice at each step (e.g., Kruskal’s MST algorithm).</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Store solutions to overlapping subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci numbers, longest common subsequence).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These principles improve problem-solving efficiency and applicability to real-world scenarios.</p>

        <h2>4. Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures</h2>

            <li><strong>Tries:</strong> Efficient for prefix-based searching (e.g., autocomplete).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These structures optimize memory usage and reduce time complexity.</p>

        <p>Applications include real-time analytics, gaming, and financial systems.</p>

        <h2>6. Trees vs. Graphs and Their Traversals</h2>
        <p>Trees and graphs differ fundamentally:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trees:</strong> Acyclic, hierarchical structures (e.g., family trees).</li>
