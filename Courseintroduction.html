    <h2>Course Introduction: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h2>

    <div class="course-content">
        <p>The course <strong>"Design and Analysis of Algorithms"</strong> delves into the core principles of algorithm design, analysis, and selection to address complex problems efficiently. The following are the primary topics covered:</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p class="section-title">1. Algorithm Design and Analysis:</p>

                    <li>Develop algorithms to solve computational problems, focusing on creating step-by-step procedures to achieve desired outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate algorithm performance and efficiency using Big O notation, which helps in understanding the time and space complexity.</li>
                    <li>Analyze trade-offs in algorithm selection for specific tasks, considering factors such as execution time, memory usage, and ease of implementation.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <p class="section-title">2. Sorting Algorithms:</p>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Examine various sorting techniques, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Bubble Sort</span>: A simple comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Insertion Sort</span>: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with the assumption that the initial part of the array is already sorted.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Selection Sort</span>: Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Quick Sort</span>: An efficient, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around the pivot.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Merge Sort</span>: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Heap Sort</span>: A comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure, which is an almost complete binary tree.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These algorithms are crucial for data organization and processing in a specified order, which is vital for numerous computational tasks such as searching, merging, and data analysis.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <p class="section-title">3. String Search Algorithms:</p>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Investigate algorithms for pattern searching within strings, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Boyer-Moore</span>: An efficient string searching algorithm that skips sections of the text to reduce the number of comparisons.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Rabin-Karp</span>: Uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text, with a rolling hash function to quickly update the hash value.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)</span>: Utilizes the information gathered during the preprocessing phase to skip unnecessary comparisons in the search phase.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Brute Force Approach</span>: A straightforward method that checks for the presence of the pattern at every possible position in the text.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These algorithms are applicable in text searching, DNA sequence matching, and document processing, where efficient pattern matching is essential.</p>
